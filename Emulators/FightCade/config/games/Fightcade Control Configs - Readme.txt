-=-Notes-=-

This works for Capcom games with a 6 button layout and all Neo Geo games. The Capcom games with less than 6 have different names for the buttons.

-=-Setup-=-

1. Copy the executable into your ../fightcade/config/games/ folder.

2. Rename an allready configured 6 button Capcom game's config to "cps.ini"

3. Rename an allready configured Neo Geo game's config to "neo.ini"

4. Run the executable and then play some games.
